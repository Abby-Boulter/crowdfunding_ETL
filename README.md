# crowdfunding_ETL

For this ETL project, an ETL pipeline was built using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods (then again using regular expressions for practice) to extract and transform the data. After the data was transformed, four CSV files were created and the CSV file data was used to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data was loaded into a Postgres database.
